Changes in version 0.2.2
- added support for compound 'Cache-Control' values. Values with defined time (e.g. 'max-age=N') are now truncated and only their name is processed. 
  Before the change, they were treated as unknown values. This change will provide different fingerprint values than version 0.2.1 if such 'Cache-Control' values are present.
- added additional 'Content-Type' values
- tests on Ubuntu 22.04 and Tshark 3.6.2
